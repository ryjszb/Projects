To let the student in MSSP program learn through collaborative statistical work
on real problems, practicum course provides our group with a project sponsored
by partners in the City of Boston. We have data comes from the 911 dispatch
system, which covers police, fire, and EMS and potential dataset which connects
individuals in need of shelter with space in facilities. To understand how we
provide shelters to homeless people and identify potential improvements, we
cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the datasets and made a shiny app to display
to the representatives from the City of Boston.
